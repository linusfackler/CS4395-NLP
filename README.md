Most of the work was done in Python, either in an IDE or a notebook. Libraries used include the ones above, mainly for processing text or machine learning.

### Soft Skills
Here are some of the soft skills developed during this course:
- Problem Solving: As in every computer science related project, problem solving is most involved in every project. Solutions have to be found which involves critical thinking
- Time management: Assignments/projects had to be delivered on time
- Public speaking: Some projects had to be presented in front of an entire class
- Ability to work in teams: Some projects allowed the work in teams, improving skills to work not just by yourself
- Ability to work independently: Most projects are to be solved independently, where you can't rely on anyone but yourself

## Summary
### My skills in NLP
This course added skills of a, for me, previously untouched field of computer science. It added a lot of knowledge to my previously existing knowledge of Python, machine learning, and problem solving skills in general. It added a different view to the way I see and handle certain things, specifically anything involving text or languages.

### Enthusiasm for NLP
Nowadays, it is impossible to escape this field, as language technologies become more and more present in our day-to-day life. (We know what I'm talking about). Jumping into it is the best way to move with it. This was not only interesting, but fun. More fun than most other fields of CS have been so far.

### Plans for future projects
I'm planning to learn more about specifically the link of NLP and machine learning. Machine learning was fun, but not as much as NLP, since it was too much pure data science and not enough development. NLP is a good combination of both. I hope to be more involved in NLP, especially once I attend grad school next year.
