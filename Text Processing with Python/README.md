# Portfolio Assignment 1: Text Processing with Python

[Python File](https://github.com/linusfackler/CS4395-NLP/blob/main/Text%20Processing%20with%20Python/main.py)

[Data](https://github.com/linusfackler/CS4395-NLP/blob/main/Text%20Processing%20with%20Python/data/data.csv)

## What the program does
This program reads in an employee list from a csv file. The path for which is passed in as sysarg.
It then processes the input and prints out the list in a user-friendly format.
When processing the data, using regular expressions, it checks if the employee ID and phone number comply with a certain format. If they don't, they will be formatted.

## How to run it
Your machine needs to have Python3 installed.
Navigate to the script file in your terminal and enter:
```
python main.py <data path>

For example:
python main.py "data/data.csv"
```

## Strengths and weaknesses of Python for text processing
A clear stength of Python is the access to a huge amount of libraries, such as regex, pandas, or even a csv library specifically for csv files.
Python has the ability to manage data structures quickly, as seen in this project with pickles, for example.
The only weaknesses I can think of right now are Python in general, not necessarily for text processing. These include its slow speed due to the fact that it's dynamically-typed and interpreted.

## What I learned in this assignment
Most of what I have used in this assignment was a review for me. I have not yet used Pickles before though, so that's something I have learned now. Other than that, I have some experience with ML, and therefore have used Python a lot before already.
I enjoy it every time and it's by now my favorite programming language.
