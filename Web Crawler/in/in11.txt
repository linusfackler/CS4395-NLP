Pink Floyd have confirmed the release of a  Dark Side Of The Moon  50th anniversary box set, which will be available through Warners on March 24. At the same time, the band have revealed that the CD edition and first ever vinyl issue of Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974   will be released independently. The band have also announced a new The Dark Side Of The Moon experience is set to open at London's word-famous Planetarium, where the band first held the original press launch for the album in February 1973 Prog reported this possible news last week when announcing that a new book about the album, The Dark Side Of The Moon By Pink Floyd , will be published by Thames And Hudson, who inadvertently let slip about the impending box set on their website. The deluxe box set itself includes a CD and gatefold vinyl of the newly remastered studio album and Blu-Ray and DVD audio featuring the original 5.1 mix and remastered stereo versions.  The set also includes an additional new Blu-ray disc of a Dolby Atmos mix plus CD and LP of The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974 . Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974 was originally recorded in November 1974 as part of the band’s winter tour, and this will serve as the first time it will be available as a stand-alone album, with artwork featuring an original 1973 line-drawn cover by George Hardie. Pink Floyd will also invite a new generation of animators to enter a competition to create music videos for any of the 10 songs on the iconic 1973 album. Animators can enter up to 10 videos, one per song on the album, with a winner selected from a panel of experts which will include Pink Floyd’s Nick Mason, Aubrey 'Po' Powell (Pink Floyd's creative director) and the BFI (British Film Institute). The deadline for submissions is November 30th 2023. To enter and for more information go here . In March, an official 'full dome experience' featuring stunning visuals of the solar system, played out to The Dark Side Of The Moon album, will be released in Planetariums around the world.
