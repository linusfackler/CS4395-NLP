## What the program does
This program implements a web crawler that extracts information from websites based on a starting website, compiles information about important words and builds a knowledge base.
This knowledge base can later be used to create a chatbot.

## How to run it
Your machine needs to have Python3 installed.
Navigate to the script file in your terminal and enter:
```
python3 main.py
```
(You might have to create folders 'in' and 'out' in script destination)
