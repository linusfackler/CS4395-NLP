The stories told about the Syd and the early 70's eras are amazing, but after the Wish You Were Here tour chapter, it's less and less interesting.
Another con is that it became outdated, I think revised edition should be published, in order to include all the info concerning the Floyd reunion for Live 8, as well as David and Roger's solo tours from 1999 to date.
This book, however, acts as a GREAT reference for all bootleg collectors, as it documents every single confirmed gig by the band and all members as solo and guest appearances.
But after all, there are not many Pink Floyd historians out there so, I don't think I can complain more than I have.
I do recommend the book, it's a very interesting read for all fans.
