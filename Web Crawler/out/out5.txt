Home News Prog Abbey Road and Pink Floyd launch exclusive Dark Side merch collection By Jerry Ewing ( Prog ) Contributions from Merlin Alderslade published 1 March 2023 Pink Floyd's seminal 1973 album The Dark Side Of The Moon celebrates its 50th anniversary this month (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab) (opens in new tab) (Image credit: EMI) Abbey Road Studios are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Pink Floyd 's legendary The Dark Side Of The Moon album with the announcement of their very first collaboration with the band on a range of exclusive merchandise.
"We are delighted to announce the first ever official collaboration between Pink Floyd and Abbey Road," says Abbey Road’s General Manager Jeremy Huffelmann.
"The album is a landmark in modern music and a milestone in Pink Floyd and Abbey Road’s long shared history."
The new range features short and long sleeve t-shirts, bucket hats, hoodies and a tote bag, along with mugs, keyrings, magnets, coasters, shot glasses, guitar picks and straps, as well as a one of a kind ‘session sheet’.
"The Abbey Road team has delved into our extensive archive to access assets that have been unseen by the public, and indeed Pink Floyd, until now," adds Abbey Road’s Head of Retail Jason Hart.
"We have lovingly replicated a one-of-a-kind session sheet dated 30 May 1972 ‘onwards’ taken from the first day of recording of The Dark Side Of The Moon , accompanied by annotations of personnel, effects and equipment used during the sessions.
This is a collection that has been carefully curated with music fans at the heart, with elements that are trend-led to take the much-loved artwork to a new, style-conscious audience."
You can view the new collection here .
Released on March 1, 1973, The Dark Side Of The Moon has widely become recognised as Pink Floyd's definitive album, and one of the most important and influential albums in the history of rock music.
Last month, it was revealed that former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters has controversially re-recorded The Dark Side Of The Moon without his Floyd bandmates, telling The Telegraph : "Let’s get rid of all this ‘we’ crap!
Of course we were a band, there were four of us, we all contributed – but it’s my project and I wrote it.
