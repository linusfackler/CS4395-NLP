## What the program does
This program creates a chatbot that can answer questions about bands, including what genre it is and what members are active.
It gets the information by scraping from wikipedia pages.

## How to run it
Your machine needs to have Python3 installed, as well as spaCy en_core_web_sm downloaded.
Navigate to the script file in your terminal and enter:
```
python3 main.py
```

To ask about a band, the word "band" must be in the question.
Possible questions are the bands origin, genre, members, and active years.
