## Local Languages, Third Spaces, and other High-Resource Scenarios

## Problem addressed
This paper addresses the problem of developing and evaluating language technologies for low-resource language in high-resource scenarios, such as multilingual communities and online platforms. These include for example Māori, the indigenous language of New Zealand, and Cherokee, a Native American language spoken in southeastern parts of the US. These languages are not as well-resourced as more commonly spoken languages such as English or Spanish. The author argues while much attention has been given to low-resource languages in isolated communities, there is also a great need for technologies that support multilingualism and  language diversity in modern communication contexts. Also emphasized is the need for collaboration and community engagement in the development and evaluation of language technologies for low-resource languages.

## Prior work
Bird reviews prior work on language technologies for low-resource languages, including speech recognition, machine translation, and language documentation. He also talks about recent advances in computational linguistics and natural language processing that have the potential to improve language technologies in high-resource scenarios. There has been a growing interest in developing language technologies for low-resource technologies, specifically those spoken by indigenous and minority communities. Some challenges faced when developing such technologies for low-resource languages are for example the lack of digital resources and tools, as well as limited access to data and speakers, since those languages are not commonly spoken.

## Unique contributions of this paper
The unique contribution of this paper is its emphasis on the importance of developing language technologies that are inclusive of diverse linguistic communities, as mentioned in the first paragraph, in modern communication contexts, such as social media or messaging apps. Bird mentions that in those modern communication contexts, people are increasingly communicating across linguistic and cultural boundaries, and that language diversity is becoming an asset, rather than a liability. He agrees that language technologies must be developed with the needs of multilingual users in mind, and that evaluation methods must consider the complex sociolinguistic contexts in which these technologies are used.

## How the authors evaluated their work
Bird draws on his own experience working on language technologies for low-resource languages in high-resource scenarios to evaluate his work, including the development of speech-recognition systems for multilingual communities and the creation of language resources for online platforms. He doesn’t provide a clear evaluation of his work in this paper, other than an overview of challenges and approaches to developing language technologies for low-resource languages, as well as the importance of language diversity in modern communication contexts. Steven Bird spent 25 years working on methods to capture, enrich, and analyze data from endangered languages, showing his expertise and first-hand experience in this field, emphasizing the importance of the problems addressed in this paper.

## Importance of their work
I think Bird’s work was important because it highlights the need for language technologies that are inclusive of diverse linguistic communities that are often overlooked or forgotten in the world of technology. It reveals not only challenges, but also opportunities for this field of natural language processing to improve further.
